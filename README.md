Dear Bynder Team,

thanks for the interessting interview.
In this Repo you'll find the solution for your task.
I wrote it with Python, if you want it as sh script I can translate it.

In the Script I just use standard python libs so just make sure you have python 2.x or python 3.x installed.

to start the script just:

$ python check_files.py --PARAM1=FolderWhereYouWantCheckDuplicatedFiles
